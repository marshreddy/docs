# Our API Specification

## Overview

Central to the WhereIsMyTransport platform is our transport API. It is based on [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer), [JSON](http://www.json.org/), [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/2/) and [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect/). These are standards which are broadly supported in the industry.

### Introduction

#### API Endpoint

The following address is the standard URL endpoint to be used to access the various resources of the API.

`https://platform.whereismytransport.com`

For example, the [agencies endpoint](#agencies) would be queried at https://platform.whereismytransport.com/api/agencies.

#### HTTP verbs

The API uses standard HTTP verbs as part of the uniform interface and must be used in combination with the resource URIs in order to describe the requested action.

| Verb | Description |
| :-------- | :---------- |
| `GET` | To retrieve a resource or collection of resources. |
| `POST` | To create a resource. |

#### HTTP status codes

The status code in an HTTP request's response describes the outcome of the performed action. Listed below are the supported status codes used in the API.

| Status code | Description |
| :------------ | :---------- |
| `200 Ok` | The GET request was successful. The retrieved resource is returned in the response body. |
| `201 Created` | The POST request was successful. The new resource is returned in the response body. |
| `400 Bad Request` | The request has invalid or missing parameters. |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Authentication failed. |
| `403 Forbidden` | Access denied to this resource. |
| `404 Not Found` | The requested resource does not exist. |
| `406 Not Acceptable` | The server cannot send data in a format requested in the Accept header. |
| `415 Unsupported Media Type` | The server does not support the format as specified in the Content-Type header. |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Too many requests have occurred in a given amount of time. |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | The server has encountered an unexpected error. |

#### Accept type

The **Accept** header describes the format of the content that the client can accept. All requests must specify this header as **application/json**. If the **Accept** header is not specified or the type is set to a value other than **application/json** then a **406 Not Acceptable** [status code](#http-status-codes) will be returned.

##### Sample request

```
GET api/agencies
Accept: application/json
```

#### Content type

The **Content-Type** header describes the format of the data being posted to the server. All POST requests must specify this header as **application/json**. If the **Content-Type** header is not specified or the type is set to a value other than **application/json** then a **415 Unsupported Media Type** [status code](#http-status-codes) will be returned.

##### Sample request

```
POST api/journeys
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
```

#### Compression

The API compresses response data using GZIP compression as defined by the HTTP 1.1 specification. The **Content-Encoding** response header will be set to **gzip** when the response body is compressed.

**Note:** No other methods of compression are supported. Request compression is not supported.

#### Rate Limiting

The API enforces rate limits to help fairly distribute resources and protect against bursts of traffic. The API supplies the `X-Rate-Limit-*` headers for all successful requests which describe the current rate limit state.

| Header | Type | Description |
| :--------- | :--- | :---- |
| X-Rate-Limit-Limit | string | Request limit timespan. |
| X-Rate-Limit-Remaining | integer | Number of requests left in the rate limit window. |
| X-Rate-Limit-Reset | [DateTime](#datetime) | Date and time when the rate limit will reset. |

**Note:** Rate limited responses do not contain the `X-Rate-Limit-*` headers.

##### Sample response

```
Content-Type: application/json
X-Rate-Limit-Limit: 1s
X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: 49
X-Rate-Limit-Reset: 2016-08-30T10:31:15.8791107Z
```

HTTP responses will return a `429 Forbidden` status code for any rate limited request until the rate limit has dropped below the required threshold. The remaining seconds until the rate limit is reset is shown in the `Retry-After` response header.

##### Sample response

```json
429 Unknown
Content-Type: application/json
Retry-After: 53
{
    "message": "Quota has been reached."
}
```

#### HTTPS

All API access is performed over HTTPS only. If a resource is requested using **http://** then a **403 Forbidden** [status code](#http-status-codes) will be returned.

### Authorisation

The API uses the standards as set in the [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/2/) and [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect/) specifications. WhereIsMyTransport provides its own _security token service_ which issues tokens to applications so that they can authenticate themselves against the API. To authorise an application, one must first acquire a **client_id** and **client_secret** from the [Developer Portal](https://developer.whereismytransport.com).

Using client credentials one can make requests against the _security token service_ to retrieve a token.  When requesting a token, the scopes that are required must also be specified. Currently, the only scope available is `transportapi:all` which provides full access to the API.

**Note:** The content type of **application/x-www-form-urlencoded** must be used for this request.

#### Security token endpoint

The following is the full URL endpoint used to retrieve a token.

`https://identity.whereismytransport.com/connect/token`

##### Sample request

```
POST https://identity.whereismytransport.com/connect/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
client_id=6a73386c-5bbf-4b4b-ae09-0ed45d87b5ad
client_secret=neph3dext3Ct+QHc5wClxTWE1Y+AKNTS28UFH39SXy4=
grant_type=client_credentials
scope=transportapi:all
```

##### Sample response

```json
201 Created
{
    "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJ32aQiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIfg1iCI6ImEzck1VZ01Gd8d0UGNsTGE2eUYz...",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

Once this token is received, it must be added to the **Authorization** HTTP request header with the prefix of "Bearer" in order to perform successful requests against the API.

##### Sample request

```
GET api/agencies
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJ32aQiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIfg1iCI6ImEzck1VZ01Gd8d0UGNsTGE2eUYz...
```

A **401 Unauthorized** [status code](#http-status-codes) will be returned if the request is either missing the **Authorization** header or if the token has expired.

#### Token expiry

The token response model will also contain a field called **expires_in**. This field denotes how long the token will be fresh since the token was issued (in seconds). After this period elapses that very token will become stale, and a new token will need to be retreived from the security token endpoint. 

### Errors

The API uses conventional HTTP [status code](#http-status-codes) to indicate the result of a request. Codes within the 200s indicate that the request was successful. Codes within the 400s indicate that the request was somehow badly formed (such as a missing or incorrectly formatted field). 500s are typically returned when something unexpected goes wrong on the server. 

The **error response model** below will be returned for any error.

#### Error response model

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--------- | :--- | :---- |
| message | string | A general message indicating the type of error. |
| fields | Dictionary of error messages | Human-readable error messages for each problematic input or query field. Only returned for a 400 (Bad Request). |

##### Sample response

```json
400 Bad Request
{
    "message": "The request has invalid or missing fields. Please visit our documentation.",
    "fields": {
        "timeType": [
            "Value 'After' is invalid. TimeType must be one of 'DepartAfter', 'ArriveBefore'."
        ],
        "maxItineraries": [
            "Value '10' is invalid. The maximum number of itineraries that may be requested is 5."
        ]
    }
}
```

### Identifiers

Almost all resources in the API are identified through the use of a globally unique identifier. This identifier is specified as a 22 character long, case-sensitive string of URL-friendly characters; __a__ to __z__, __A__ to __Z__, __0__ to __9__, - (hyphen) and _ (underscore). See the **id** field in the sample response below.

##### Sample request

```
GET api/agencies/5kcfZkKW0ku4Uk-A6j8MFA
```

##### Sample response

```json
{
    "id": "5kcfZkKW0ku4Uk-A6j8MFA",
    "href": "https://platform.whereismytransport.com/api/agencies/5kcfZkKW0ku4Uk-A6j8MFA",
    "name": "MyCiTi",
    "culture": "en"
}
```

**Note:** Identifiers are case-sensitive.

### Resource Linking

The API presents a simple and elegant approach to referencing related resources. Every available resource has a hypertext reference field, **href**. This value represents a fully qualified URL to where the resource resides. Presenting such a field for every resource aids discoverability by allowing for new resources to be consumed by just embedding a new reference link.

For example, the sample below demonstrates a stop with its agency represented as a sub-resource, both having **id** and **href** fields.

##### Sample request

```
GET api/stops/eBTeYLPXOkWm5zyfjZVaZg
```

##### Sample response

```json
200 Ok
{
    "id": "eBTeYLPXOkWm5zyfjZVaZg",
    "href": "https://platform.whereismytransport.com/api/stops/eBTeYLPXOkWm5zyfjZVaZg",
    "agency": {
        "id": "5kcfZkKW0ku4Uk-A6j8MFA",
        "href": "https://platform.whereismytransport.com/api/agencies/5kcfZkKW0ku4Uk-A6j8MFA",
        "name": "MyCiTi",
        "culture": "en"
    },
    "name": "Adderley",
    "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [
            18.42484,
            -33.92055
        ]
    },
    "modes": [
        "Bus"
    ]
}
```

### Excluding data

In order to reduce payload, it is possible to exclude certain objects or collections from the model returned in the body of the HTTP response. This is done through the use of the **exclude** query. Fields which are _excludable_ are described in the specification with the [Excludable](#excluding-data) tag.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| :-------------- | :--- | :---- | :---- |
| exclude | string | Optional | A string of comma-separated object or collection names to excluded from the response. |

When excluding resource objects, the containing object with their **id** and **href** fields will remain. This is to preserve discoverability while still reducing payload. Collections, on the other hand, will be excluded entirely.

##### Sample request

The request below will exclude **geometry** and **directions** from the response model.

```
POST api/journeys?exclude=geometry,directions
```

### Understanding Scheduled Data

All retrievable entities from the API constitute scheduled data. This means that entities may change over time. They may not even exist forever. An agency, for example, may schedule a line's name to change, not now, but only after a certain date.  A new stop could be scheduled to only be returned from the API at some given date.

The important thing to note that is an entity could be deprecated in a future schedule. This means that any entity resource URL could return a **404 Not Found** [status code](#http-status-codes). Furthermore, new entities could be added at any point. Applications built on this API are highly encouraged to cater for this.

### Pagination

Collection endpoints are paginated so to ensure that responses are easier to handle and that payload is kept to a manageable size.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :-------------- | :--- | :---- |
| limit | integer | The number of entities to be returned. The default and maximum is typically 100 unless otherwise specified. |
| offset | integer | The zero-based offset of the first entity returned. The default is always 0.  |

##### Sample request

The request below will retrieve 10 stops from the 50th stop onwards.

```
GET api/stops?limit=10&offset=50
```

### Formatting Standards

#### DateTime

A typical format for encoding of date and time in JSON is to use the ISO 8601 standard. This is a well-established specification which is both human readable and widely supported by many web-based frameworks.

ISO 8601 date and time strings can be represented as "2016-11-19T07:22Z" (7:22 AM on the 19th November 2016).

More information can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).

Acceptable DateTime input values are limited to between 1 day in the past and 6 days in the future. This allows the user to query on any day of the week, but it should be remembered that public holidays, schedule changes and daylight savings time changes might mean that results for the same day might differ from week to week. Supplying a DateTime that exceeds this limitation will result in a **400 Bad Request** [status code](#http-status-codes) response. In the case of a default that falls outside this limitation, the default will use the limitation value.

**Note:** ISO 8601 dates are timezone-agnostic and so are communicated in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).

#### Culture

The appropriate culture format used in the API is based on RFC 4646. This unique name is a combination of an ISO 639 two-letter lowercase culture code associated with a language and an ISO 3166 two-letter uppercase subculture code associated with a country or region.

For example, _en-US_ refers to English (United States) and _en-ZA_ to English (South Africa).

The detailed specification can be found [here](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4646.txt).

#### Cost

Monetary amounts are represented by the cost object, which is made up of an amount, as a decimal value, and the applicable currency code. The currency code is such as defined in ISO 4217. For example, **ZAR** represents the South African Rand. More information and a full list of currency codes can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).

##### Sample

The following cost object represents the value of R10,50.

```json
{
    "cost": {
        "amount": 10.5,
        "currencyCode": "ZAR"
    }
}
```

#### GeoJSON

[GeoJSON](http://geojson.org) is a JSON format for encoding geographic data structures. The API uses the _Point_, _MultiPoint_ and _LineString_ geometry types.

A typical GeoJSON structure consists of a **type** field and an array of **coordinates**.

**Note:**  GeoJSON represents geographic coordinates with longitude first and then latitude, `[longitude, latitude]`. i.e. `[x, y]` in the Cartesian coordinate system.

##### Sample

The following GeoJSON Point represents the coordinates for Cape Town's city centre.

```json
{
    "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [
            18.41703,
            -33.92685
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Point

In order to provide a geographic position through the query string, a comma-separated latitude and longitude must be provided.

##### Sample request

```
GET api/stops?point=-33.92543,18.43644
```

**Note: ** The ordering of these two coordinates is latitude first and then longitude.

#### BoundingBox

In order to provide a geographic bounding box through the query string, a comma-separated SW (south west) latitude, SW longitude, NE (north east) latitude and NE longitude must be provided in that order.  These coordinates represent the south west and north east corners of the bounding box.

##### Sample request

```
GET api/stops?bbox=-33.93943,18.39801,-33.92111,18.44301
```

#### Distance

Distance is returned as an object consisting of the distance **value** (an integer) and the associated **unit** symbol.

##### Sample response

```json
{  
    "distance": {  
        "value": 133,
        "unit": "m"
    }
}
```

**Note:** The API currently only supports the metric system and distance is currently returned in metres.

## Specification

### Modes

The mode of transport describes the type of vehicle that is used along a line. The following table describes the modes currently supported by the API.

| Value | Description |
| :--------- | :---- |
| LightRail | A service for any light rail or street level system within a metropolitan area. |
| Subway | An underground rail service. |
| Rail | An overground railway transportation service. |
| Bus | A bus service utilising a road network. |
| Ferry | A boat service. |
| Coach | A long distance bus service. |
| ShareTaxi | A service with vehicles typically smaller than buses operating on routes without timetables. |

**Note:** New modes will be supported in the future and thus be added to this list. Unused modes may be removed over time. Be careful when parsing directly to an enum for modes of transport.

| omit | [Filter](#filter) | Optional | The explicit set of modes or agencies to exclude. Omit will always take preference. |
| fareProducts | Array of [Identifier](#identifiers) | Optional | The list of [fare product](#fare-products) identifiers to use when calculating the journey fare. |
| maxItineraries | integer | Optional | The maximum number of itineraries to return. This must be a value between or including 1 and 5. Default is 5. |

#### TimeType

Time type can either be **DepartAfter** or **ArriveBefore**.

**DepartAfter** (the default) indicates that the journey must be calculated to depart after the specified time, at the earliest.

**ArriveBefore** indicates that the journey must be calculated to arrive before the specified time, at the latest.

#### Profile

The profile specifies how the itineraries should be prioritised.

**ClosestToTime** (the default) returns itineraries absolutely closest to the requested date; earliest for **DepartAfter**, and latest for **ArriveBefore**.

**FewestTransfers** returns itineraries with fewest connections between transport vehicles, and then also prioritising by closest to time.

#### Filter

A filter can be specified to explicitly use or omit certain agencies or modes from the requested journey.

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--------- | :--- | :--- |
| agencies | Array of [Identifier](#identifiers) | A list of agencies to use in or omit from the journey. |
| modes | Array of [Mode](#mode) | A list of modes to use or omit in the journey. |

```

### Legs

A leg is a section of an itinerary carried out by a passenger on one mode of transport (including walking) from some departure point to an arrival point.

#### Types of legs

The API currently supports two types of legs, each with a different response model.

A _Walking_ leg is one which the passenger is to travel by foot from one waypoint to another.  Walking legs are usually accompanied with directions.

A _Transit_ leg is one which uses a public transportation service based on scheduled or absolute frequency-based stop times.

#### Leg behaviour

Transit legs may have one of currently two different behaviours, which could be considered sub-types of Transit legs.

A _Static_ leg is one where the given times are from a frequency-based or static timetable, where the intention is that the vehicle stops at the time given in the waypoint. Whether the vehicle adheres to this time in reality can still be dependent on delays or other external factors.

An _Estimated_ leg is one where the given times are an estimate based on the probability of a vehicle arriving at or before that time to a reasonable confidence level. Estimated legs result from travel on a route without exact times nor formal timetables.

#### Leg response model

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--------- | :--- | :---- |
| type | string | The [type of leg](#types-of-legs), either _Walking_ or _Transit_. |

| vehicle | [Vehicle](#vehicle-response-model) | **[**[Excludable](#excluding-data)**]** Identifying information for the vehicle that is used on this leg of the itinerary. This is only returned for _Transit_ legs. |
| fare | [Fare](#fare-response-model) | If available, the fare for this leg. |
| waypoints | Array of [Waypoint](#waypoint-response-model) | **[**[Excludable](#excluding-data)**]** The sequence of ordered waypoints that make up this leg. |

#### Retrieving a specific leg

##### Sample request

Retrieving an itinerary's leg can be done using the index of that leg as it exists in the itinerary. The index begins counting from 1.

#### Pickup and Drop Off Type

A waypoint may have pickup and drop off types. These types are independent of each other; a vehicle may pick up passengers but not drop them off and vice versa.

No value indicates that the vehicle may pick up (or drop off) passengers at this waypoint.

A value of _Never_ indicates that the vehicle does not pick up (or drop off) passengers at this waypoint.

A value of _OnRequest_ indicates that the passenger must specially arrange to be picked up (or dropped off) at this waypoint, such as by phone or by coordinating with the driver.
